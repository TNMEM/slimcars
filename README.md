Really two projects ...
    1-api of Slim php microframework with NotORM database PDO to mysql.
      ... OR with php_crud_api.php single-file RESTful database handling.
    2-frontend of html with jQuery javascript handling ajax calls.
      css by skeleton.css, normalize.css and very little custom css.
